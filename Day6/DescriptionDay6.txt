Description of Day6:

On Day 6, you learned how to use the Node.js crypto module to perform cryptographic operations. You generated random bytes for secure tokens and hashed strings using algorithms like SHA-256. This exercise demonstrated how to implement basic security features such as data hashing and random value generation, which are essential for authentication and data integrity
